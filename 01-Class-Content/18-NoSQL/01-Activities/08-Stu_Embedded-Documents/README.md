# üêõ Query on Embedded Document Not Returning Matching Data

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a book store owner, I should be able to execute a query that returns a list of books that have a price of less than $10.
// db.books.find({price: {$lt: 10}})
// {$lt: 10} is a MongoDB query operator that is used to match values that are less than the specified value. lt stands for less than.

* As a book store owner, I should be able to execute a query that returns a list of books that has at least one featured author.
// db.books.find({authors: {$elemMatch: {featured: true}}})

## Expected Behavior

When I query the embedded data using the `db.collection.find()` method, the matching data should be returned.
// db.books.find({price: {$lt: 10}})

## Actual Behavior

When I query the embedded data using the `db.collection.find()` method, no matching data is returned.


## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

1. In the Unsolved folder, run `npm install` and `node server`.

2. Open Insomnia and enter the GET Route `/price-less-than-10`. A list of books that have a price of less than $10 is not returned.

3. Open Insomnia and enter the GET Route `/featured-authors`. A list of books that have at least one featured author is not returned.
