In the server directory we have the following files and directories:
first we have the package.json file that is used to install the dependencies for the application.
The package-lock.json file is used to lock the dependencies for the application.
The server.js file is the main file that runs the application.
The routes directory has the htmlRoutes.js file that is used to route the user to the correct page.
