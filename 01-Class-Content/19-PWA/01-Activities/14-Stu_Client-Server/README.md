* What is a proxy server?
// In short proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the Internet. When you connect to the Internet, your computer contacts a proxy server, which in turn contacts the website you want to visit. The proxy server then returns the requested information to your computer, which displays it on your screen. Proxy servers are used for a variety of reasons, including to increase security, to increase performance, and to filter content.
