# üêõ The Delete Button Does Not Remove the List Item When Clicked

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to be able to delete a list item from a list when I click on the list item.
// we need to add an event listener to the list item
// by clicking on the list item, we need to remove it from the list
// we need to remove the list item from the database
// we need to update the database
// we can start by going to the index.js file
//export const deleteDb = async (id) => {
  console.log('DELETE from the database', id);
  const todosDb = await openDB('todos', 1);
  const tx = todosDb.transaction('todos', 'readonly');
  const store = tx.objectStore('todos');
  const request = store.delete(id);
  const result = await request;
  console.log('result.value', result);
  return result;
};
 

* As a user, I want to be able to edit a list item when I click the Edit button.

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks on an item, it is removed from the list of tasks.

When a user clicks on the Edit button, a text input is displayed with the list item to be edited. After pressing the Enter key, the list item is updated accordingly.

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks on the item, it is not removed from the list of tasks.

When a user clicks the Edit button, a text input does not appear with the list item to be edited. After pressing the Enter key, the list item is not updated properly.
