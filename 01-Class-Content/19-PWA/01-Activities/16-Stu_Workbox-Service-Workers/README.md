# üìñ Use Workbox to Generate a Service Worker

* As an app user, I want to be able to precache assets and view my app even when offline.
//first step is to install the workbox webpack plugin
// the code is npm install workbox-webpack-plugin --save-dev
//second step is to add the following code to the webpack.config.js file 
// const { GenerateSW } = require('workbox-webpack-plugin');
// module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        new GenerateSW()

    ]
// fourth step is to add the following code to the index.js file
//fifth step is to test the service worker by using the network tab in the dev tools and selecting offline

## Acceptance Criteria

* It‚Äôs done when logic is added to the `index.js` to register a service worker.
// we can add the following code to the index.js file by using the following code

* It's done when the `webpack.config.js` file is updated to use the GenerateSW class of the workbox webpack plugin.

* It‚Äôs done when the app is started using `npm install` and `npm run start:dev` and a log from GenerateSW appears in the console with a message similar to the following: `‚ÄúThe service worker at service-worker.js will precache 5 URLs, totaling 35.1 kB.‚Äù`
// work

* It‚Äôs done when a `service-worker.js` file is generated in the build directory.

* It‚Äôs done when the service worker is active and the app is still visible even when offline.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [Workbox docs on generating a service worker with webpack using GenerateSW](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/generate-service-worker/webpack)

* [Workbox docs on GenerateSW](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-webpack-plugin.GenerateSW)

* [Simulate offline behavior with Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/tools-for-pwa-developers#simulate_offline_behavior)

* [Interact with service workers with Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/tools-for-pwa-developers#interact_with_service_workers_in_the_browser)

## üí° Hints

* How can we use Chrome DevTools to test if our service worker is active and our app is still visible even when offline?
// we can test by using the network tab in the dev tools and selecting offline

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why don't JavaScript modules work inside service workers?
// JavaScript modules are not supported in service workers.
//because
