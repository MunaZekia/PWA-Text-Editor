# üìê Add Comments to Implementation of IndexedDB

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in the [database.js](./Unsolved/src/js/database.js) file.

## üìù Notes

This activity takes place in Chrome DevTools; we will hook up the UI in later activities.

To launch the application and view the IndexedDB store in Chrome DevTools, follow these steps:

1. In the command line, navigate to `22-Stu_IndexedDB/Unsolved`.

2. Run `npm install`.

3. To launch the application, run `npm run start`.

4. Open the `index.html` file in the browser from the  `dist` directory.

5. To view the IndexedDB store, visit the `Application` tab in Chrome DevTools.

Refer to the documentation:

* [NPM docs on IndexedDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb)

* [MDN Web Docs on the IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does an object store in IndexedDB compare to a table or collection in other databases?
// Object stores in IndexedDB are similar to tables in other databases. They are used to store data in the form of records. Each record is a JavaScript object that contains key-value pairs. The key is used to identify the record, and the value is the data that is stored in the record.

// indexdb the size of the database is limited to 2GB.
// but the size of the object store is limited to 50GB.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
