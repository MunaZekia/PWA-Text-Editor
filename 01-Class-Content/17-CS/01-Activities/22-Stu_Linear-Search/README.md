# 🏗️ Implement a Linear Search Algorithm

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the search algorithm function can accept an input array and value to find.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns the position of the value we are searching for.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns `-1` to indicate that the value is not in the data set.

## 💡 Hints

How can we run the unit tests to test our algorithm?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a more efficient search algorithm?
// A more efficient search algorithm is the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm works by dividing the array in half and then comparing the value to the middle value of the array. If the value is less than the middle value, the algorithm will search the left half of the array. If the value is greater than the middle value, the algorithm will search the right half of the array. This process will continue until the value is found or the array is empty.
